**Abstract:**   
A stretch-induced increase of active tension is one of the most important
properties of the heart, known as the Frank-Starling law. Although a variation
of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity with sarcomere length (SL) change was found
to be involved, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully clarified.
Some recent experimental studies indicate that a reduction of the lattice
spacing between thin and thick filaments, through the increase of passive
tension caused by the sarcomeric protein titin with an increase in SL within
the physiological range, promotes formation of force-generating crossbridges
(Xbs). However, the mechanism by which the Xb concentration determines the
degree of cooperativity for a given SL has so far evaded experimental
elucidation. In this simulation study, a novel, rather simple molecular-based
cardiac contraction model, appropriate for integration into a ventricular cell
model, was designed, being the first model to introduce experimental data on
titin-based radial tension to account for the SL-dependent modulation of the
interfilament lattice spacing and to include a conformational change of
troponin I (TnI). Simulation results for the isometric twitch contraction time
course, the length-tension and the force-[Ca(2+)] relationships are comparable
to experimental data. A complete potential Frank-Starling mechanism was
analyzed by this simulation study. The SL-dependent modulation of the myosin
binding rate through titin's passive tension determines the Xb concentration
which then alters the degree of positive cooperativity affecting the rate of
the TnI conformation change and causing the Hill coefficient to be SL-
dependent.
